    <h2>Advanced CSS Selectors</h2>
    <h4>We'll start with a group of boxes</h4>
    <div id="parent">
      <div class="box4">
        These are all .box4 elements and considered DESCENDENT Selectors
      </div>
      <div class="box4">
        Each of these have been assigned ADJACENT Selectors
      </div>
      <div class="box4"></div>
      <div class="box4"></div>
      <div class="box4"></div>
      <div class="box4"></div>
      <div class="box4"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="box4">
      This box is also a .box4 element but is NOT formatted because its outside
      the ID #parent
    </div>
    <h2>PSEUDO Selectors/Classes</h2>
    <h3>Pseudo selectors/classes are a way to link states.</h3>
    <h4>Building off our boxes again, ...</h4>
    <div id="parent2">
      <div class="box5"></div>
      <div class="box5"></div>
      <div class="box5 dontselectme">
        This box was assigned a NOT selector and was ignored for the bg color
        command
      </div>
      <div class="box5"></div>
      <div class="box5">
        SELECT ME! -- It was selected by using .BOX5:NTH-CHILD(5) in CSS
      </div>
      <div class="box5"></div>
    </div>
    <h3>HOVER</h3>
    <h4>
      Notice that hovering over the above boxes, the background shifts colors.
      This is a Pseudo Selector.
    </h4>
    <h2>PSEUDO ELEMENTS</h2>
    <h3>
      Pseudo Elements are similar to Pseudo Selectors/Classes. With Pseudo
      Elements, CSS steps into the world of HTML coding. Again, we use our boxes
      below to demonstrate.
    </h3>

    <h3>::BEFORE and ::AFTER</h3>
    <h4>Behaves like inline HTML.</h4>
    <div class="box6"></div>
    <h4>
      The BEFORE gets assigned red border, AFTER gets the yellow border, and the
      default box gets the solid blue. We have shifted the BEFORE to -30px for
      TOP/LEFT and the AFTER to -30px BOTTOM/RIGHT. The layer effect comes from
      applying a Z-INDEX of -1 to BEFORE and 1 to AFTER. (This leaves the
      default box at 0 or between them).
    </h4>
    <hr />
    <h3>REAL WORLD Example</h3>
    <h4>
      Say we want to apply an effect to a hyperlink, like in the following text.
      We want a border that impersonates an underline for the link and then to
      highlight the link when hovered over.
    </h4>
    <h4 id="pseudoHover">
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit.
      <a href="#">I have a border (hover over me for a highlight).</a>
      Perspiciatis animi aliquam, qui quasi porro velit non eveniet, ipsam
      cupiditate ipsa ea magnam facilis pariatur tenetur repudiandae magni
      consequuntur repellat repellendus!
    </h4>
    <h4>
      This is accomplished through CSS assignment of conditions to the A HREF
      and the HOVER elements, through RELATIVE/ABSOLUTE positioning, and use of
      the Z-INDEX for layering.
    </h4>
    <h3>Targeting First Letter / First Line Of Elements</h3>
    <h4 id="firstLtr">
      Say we want to enlarge the first letter of a paragraph/article/post, etc.
      You just create a style element for the block of text using ::first-letter
      and give it specified font atrributes like size or weight and float it to
      the left to allow for multi-line wrap. Like we just did for this
      paragraph.
    </h4>
    <h4 id="firstLine">
      Or perhaps we want to change the attributes of the first line of a block
      of text, such as this one. We can simply create a style element for the
      block using ::first-line. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur
      adipisicing elit. Aspernatur officia architecto aperiam dignissimos culpa
      consectetur blanditiis. Maxime voluptatem sit est, eveniet totam adipisci
      neque id? Eaque maxime possimus eius omnis.
    </h4>
    <h3>USER SELECTION Customization</h3>
    <h4>
      You can control the formatting of a user-selected text on your page. This
      is when a user "highlights" a portion of the text on the page for
      temporary focus. This is simply done in CSS with ::SELECTION (does not
      require a host element) and the attributes you want changed. Go ahead.
      Select some text in this paragraph (or anywhere on this page) to test it
      out. I have set the selection to aquamarine background with black text.
    </h4>
    <h3>TRANSITIONS</h3>
    <h4>
      A smooth transition from activity to activity can really add a
      professional environment to your page/site.
    </h4>
    <a href="#" class="button">Click Me</a>
    <h4>
      We can add TRANSITION: ALL 0.2S to have a slower switch for the HOVER
      we've added to the hyperlink. (Could also just assign the transition to
      background-color and/or color instead of ALL)
